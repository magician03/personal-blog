      <description>When I first started Web Development, like everyone else, I also wished for an online Portfolio and super cool blog running on WordPress-like sites. But upon digging deep into it and spending some time on Web Development, I came to know about this awesome feature of GitHub, GitHub-Pages, where you can host and serve any number of static-sites for “free” with site names like username.github.io/project-name . So why not use this free feature and host a Personal portfolio and also a blog built upon HarpJS a static-site builder built upon Node that preprocesses the blog/anything just to HTML, CSS &amp;amp; JS.</description>
