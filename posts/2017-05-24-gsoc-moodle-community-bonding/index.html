          <p>Currently in the last of week of community bonding period, it&rsquo;s time to summarize everything I have done during this period. Community Bonding Period has started on 5th May and ends on 29th May, lasting approximately 3 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="first-week">First Week</h3>
<p>During the first week, I was busy with my fourth semester exams and Moodle Mobile Team has also been busy with custom apps and development of critical features and improvements for v3.3.0 which is scheduled for release on 26th May. Since I am already aware of the development workflow with my previous contributions to the project, during this week I was just overlooking the development, ocassionaly contacting mentor Juan Leyva for any doubts and gave my Semester exams(! :/).</p>
<h3 id="second-week">Second Week</h3>
<p>During this period, I created the list of tasks to be done in a spreadsheet to track my progress well during the Development period. The E2E-Protractor tests which were present are irrelevant as the App grew a lot in this year and needs to corrected. Also the Development Environment needs some major improvements for efficient workflow and to keep up with the updated technologies being used. Also, many new tests need to be added to test the App as there are lot of improvements, new features added in v3.1.2, v3.1.3, v3.2.0, v3.2.1, v3.3.0. The documentation pages of Moodle Mobile also need to be updated after the tasks are completed. I have created (atomic)tasks for all of these.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11NPeEESZdmo5aNxucpiuMvbpYkBvsHodGlwbzF7VDS0/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is the spreadsheet</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="third-week">Third Week</h3>
<p>During the third week, along with working on the list of tasks spreadsheet, I am involved in testing of Mobile App. Version 3.3.0 is in its Pre-Production stage and I joined the Mobile Team in testing the App on my Android 5.0 device. I have tested all functionalities of various course-modules and other core-services of the App. It is set to release on 26th May.</p>
